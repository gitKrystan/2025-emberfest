# Todo

- "REFRESH PAGE BEFORE DEMO"
- Slow down latency for loading demos
- Log each request and note when it comes back from cache
- Disable loading latency for pagination demo
- Returning to the code after the live demo that you just showed could be helpful
  Like now you see what it’s doing after I showed you — remember how little code that was?
- What does the schema translate the data into? (ReactiveResource)
  Request builder —> schema —> reactive resource would be a good mental model to drive home, at least for me
- A great point in the talk to drive home how flexible WarpDrive is
